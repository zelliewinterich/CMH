        <day> Today I sat at <place uid="commonplace">Commonplace Coffee</place> to have a super
            trendy matcha latte. Then I spent a few hours at the <place uid="ascend">rock
                gym</place>, before making my way to <place uid="posvar">campus</place>. </day>

        <day>The next day I started at <place uid="posvar">Posvar</place> before going to the <place uid="ascend">gym</place>.</day>
