<!-- 
XML markup of the song "Lilacs" from Dave Malloy's musical "Preludes". It is a musical about the fantastical life of Sergei Rachmaninoff, a pianist famous for
his highly charged, emotional pieces. This document is marked up for character references and place names, as well as the regular lyrical structure. As this 
particular song does not have traditional verses and songs, the stanzas have been sectioned off into tones. The musical has heavy themes of inner dilemma, of
self doubt and anxieties of feeling as though your peak has passed. As such, the tones of sections could be studied to observe how many songs have more positive,
negative, or neutral themes.
For the purposes of this XML doc, just know that "Rach" is short for Rachmaninoff, although there is a different character also named Rachmaninoff in the show. 
You don't have to worry about that for this, though.
