      At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, 
      <p>the Emperor Uriel Septim VII was
         assassinated</p> and 
      <p>the Amulet of Kings
         was destroyed</p>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
      down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.
      
      
      <p>The <span class="quest"><strong>assassins</strong></span> first attacked the
         Emperor</p> in the
      
      <p>White Gold Tower</p>. While the 
      <p>Blades</p> held 
      <p>them</p> back,
      
      <p>the Emperor made his way down to the
         dungeons</p>, to a 
      <p>secret escape
         route</p> built into 
      <p>one of the prison cells</p>. For
      reasons known only to 
      <p>himself</p>, the 
      <p>Emperor</p>
      
      <p>pardoned the fortunate prisoner</p> in that 
      <p>cell</p>. Some say the
      
      <p>prisoner</p> reminded 
      <p>him</p> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a 
      <p>moment of
         prophecy</p>. Whatever the case, the 
      <p>prisoner</p> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
      
      <p>Empire</p> and 
      <p>Tamriel</p> - surely a sign that
      the gods themselves were at work.
      
      The pursuing 
      <p><span class="quest"><strong>assassins</strong></span> killed the
         <span class="quest"><strong>Blades</strong></span> bodyguards</p> in a relentless
      series of sneak attacks. Eventually 
      <p><span class="quest"><strong>they</strong></span>
         struck down the Emperor
         himself</p>. Before 
      <p>he</p> fell, 
      <p>Uriel Septim VII gave the Amulet of Kings to
         the prisoner</p>, who somehow
      
      <p>made it out of the Imperial sewers</p> and
      into the light of day.
      
      The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of 
      <p>daedric cultists</p> known as the 
      <p>Mythic Dawn</p>. (Those who still suspect the 
      <p>Dark Brotherhood</p> should consider two facts: first, they would have only
      needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the 
      <p>Dark Brotherhood</p> would never be so foolish as to
      
      <p>effectively declare war on the Empire</p> and thus ensure their
      complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the 
      <p>Mythic
         Dawn</p>.)
      
      
      
      The 
      <p>Amulet of Kings</p> next surfaced at 
      <p>Weynon
         Priory</p> near 
      <p>Chorrol</p>. 
      <p>Jauffre</p>, secret 
      <p>Grandmaster of the
         <span class="quest"><strong>Blades</strong></span></p> and head of the
      
      <p>priory</p>, 
      <p>took possession of the
         amulet</p>. 
      <p>The messenger was sent off to Kvatch</p> to find a lowly 
      <p>priest</p> named 
      <p>Martin</p>.
      Unbeknownst even to 
      <p>himself</p>, 
      <p>Martin</p> was the bastard son of 
      <p>Uriel Septim VII</p>, and the last heir to the Ruby
      Throne. 
      <p>He</p> alone could use the
      
      <p>Amulet of Kings</p> to light the Dragonfires that wards the
      barrier between 
      <p>Tamriel</p> and 
      <p>Oblivion</p>, and save
      the world from the 
      <p>Mythic Dawn</p> plot.
      
      
      <p>The prisoner arrived at Kvatch</p> to find 
      <p>it</p> overrun by 
      <p>daedra</p> that had poured in
      from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of
      the
      Oblivion Crisis. How 
      <p>the prisoner closed
         the gate</p> is not recorded. Once closed, 
      <p>Martin</p> and the surviving 
      <p>Kvatch</p>
      
      <p>guardsmen</p> drove back the 
      <p>daedra</p>.
      
      Now known as the 
      <p>Hero of Kvatch</p>, 
      <p>the prisoner and Martin
         returned to Weynon Priory</p>, only to find the
      
      <p>priory</p> sacked and the 
      <p>Amulet</p> taken.
      
      <p>Jauffre</p> survived the attack, however, and
      
      <p>the three of them
         made their way to Cloud Ruler Temple</p>, bastion of
      the 
      <p>Blades</p>. This secret 
      <p>fortress</p> in
      the 
      <p>mountains</p> outside 
      <p>Bruma</p> is
      where 
      <p>Martin</p> was held safe while
      
      <p>the Hero of Kvatch searched for the lost
         Amulet</p>.
      
      Knowing only that a mysterious group called the 
      <p>Mythic
         Dawn</p> was behind the 
      <p>assassination and theft of the
         Amulet</p>, 
      <p>the Hero of Kvatch was sent to locate
         the <span class="quest"><strong>cult</strong></span></p>. With the help of
      
      <p>Baurus</p>, a 
      <p>Blade</p> in the
      service of the 
      <p>Emperor</p>, 
      <p>they</p> somehow 
      <p>used the
         Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes</p>,
      esoteric works by the madman 
      <p>Mankar Camoran</p>,
      to direct 
      <p>them</p> to the 
      <p>Mythic Dawn</p>'s secret 
      <p>lair</p>. Scholars
      familiar with the 
      <p>Commentaries</p> claim the location is not directly
      mentioned in 
      <p>them</p>. How 
      <p>they</p> did this remains a mystery.
      
      No official records exist of how 
      <p>the Hero of
         Kvatch penetrated the <span class="quest"><strong>Mythic Dawn</strong></span>'s lair</p>
      near 
      <p>Lake Arrius</p>. There is a bardic tale that claims the 
      <p>Hero</p> used 
      <p>trickery and disguise</p>, but
      that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that 
      <p>Mankar Camoran</p> was behind the 
      <p>Mythic Dawn</p>, and that the 
      <p>group</p> worshiped the daedric prince 
      <p>Mehrunes Dagon</p>. 
      <p>Mankar
         Camoran</p> believed 
      <p>himself</p> to
      be a direct descendant of the 
      <p>Camoran Usurper</p>, the infamous
      pretender to the throne of 
      <p>Valenwood</p>.
      
      Somehow 
      <p>the Hero escaped with the
         Mysterium Xarxes itself</p>, the holy book of
      the 
      <p>Mythic Dawn cult</p>. 
      <p>Mankar Camoran</p> fled to 
      <p>Oblivion</p> with the
      
      <p>Amulet of Kings</p>. With some effort and great risk to
      
      <p>his</p> sanity, 
      <p>Martin deciphered the Mysterium
         Xarxes</p> and intended to use 
      <p>it</p> to open a gateway
      to 
      <p>Mankar Camoran</p> in order to recover the
      
      <p>Amulet of Kings</p>.
      
      Before 
      <p>Martin</p> could perform the ritual
      to open the gateway, 
      <p>Mehrunes
         Dagon opened an Oblivion Gate outside Bruma</p>. 
      <p>The Hero of
         Kvatch saved the city and Martin
         by entering the gate and closing it</p> before a 
      <p>daedric siege engine</p> could destroy 
      <p>Bruma</p>
      and 
      <p>Cloud Ruler Temple</p>. Many songs and stories have been told of
      this battle and I will not retell them here. The 
      <p>Hero of Kvatch</p> was now also known as the 
      <p>Savior of Bruma</p>.
      
      With the 
      <p>city</p> and 
      <p>Cloud Ruler
         Temple</p> safe, 
      <p>Martin
         opened the portal to Mankar Camoran's
         "Paradise"</p>. The details of what transpired in
      this 
      <p>place</p> have not been recorded. All that is known is that
      
      <p>the Savior of Bruma travelled to this Paradise,
         killed Mankar Camoran, and returned with
         the Amulet of Kings</p>.
      
      With the 
      <p>Amulet</p> in hand, 
      <p>Martin Septim presented himself to the <span class="quest"><strong>Elder
               Council</strong></span> to be crowned Emperor of all
         Tamriel</p>. Once crowned 
      <p>he</p> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
      
      <p>Tamriel</p> from 
      <p>Oblivion</p>. In a last-ditch
      attempt to stop 
      <p>him</p>, 
      <p>Mehrunes Dagon launched an assault on the
         Imperial City, opening several Oblivion Gates
         within the capital itself</p>. Uncrowned,
      
      <p>Martin</p> joined the battle in the 
      <p>city streets</p>.
      
      
      <p>Mehrunes Dagon himself
         left Oblivion and entered
         Tamriel</p>, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
      Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder,
      it was
      too late to relighting the Fires. 
      <p>Martin
         Septim</p> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - 
      <p>he shattered the Amulet of
         Kings to become the avatar of the god
         Akatosh and do battle with Mehrunes
         Dagon</p>.
      
      Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
      
      <p>Mehrunes Dagon was
         defeated and sent back to Oblivion</p>.
      
      <p>The avatar of Akatosh was
         turned to stone</p> and can be seen to this day in the 
      <p>Temple of
         the One</p> in the 
      <p>Imperial City</p>. With the
      
      <p>Amulet</p> gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
      Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to 
      <p>Oblivion</p> is sealed
      forever.
