        <section style="text-align:center;">
            When studying the US Constitution, philosophical thought could be seen in several areas of the text, both literally and implied. After we read the Constitution, we decided to focus on four main philosophers: Rousseau, Montesquieu, Locke, and Hobbes. Ultimately, these four can be directly associated with important ideals and practices seen in the Constituion. But, who are these thinkers? And what exactly did they do?

            <i>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</i>
        </h2>
        <section style="margin-right: 25px; margin-left:25px;">
            Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a Swiss-born philosopher whose work would influence the Romantic Era in Europe. Raised by only his father, Rousseau was taught at a young age to respect his past and become a student of history. He became to respect the Roman and Greek systems of government, especially the Roman Republic. However, as he aged, he began to learn about music and the arts, becoming more fascinated with the finer things. Rousseau's work was grounded more in nature, behavior, and the social workings of life, rather than political theory. Of the thinkers, Rousseau was the least educated, preferring thought over practice. He was a big supporter of religious tolerance, having converted to the Protestant church. His writings also discussed theories of inequalities in life, arguing that these inequalities would become a disadvantage for any government.

            <i>John Locke</i>
        </h2>
        <section style="margin-right: 25px; margin-left:25px;">
            John Locke was born on August 29th in 1632. Born and raised in England, Locke was most notable for his contributions to philosophy. During his childhood and young adult life, Locke studied religion but quickly turned against his teachings as he began to advocate for social equality and human nature. Locke would combine his societal ideals with political ambitions, creating new natural laws as he wrote several philsophical texts. His works often focused on tolerance, both politically and religiously. In fact, the inclusion of "life, liberty, and property" within the United States Constitution was greatly influenced by Locke. His philosophy took some time to be accepted but ultimately, after the Glorious Revolution, Locke's ideals became more mainstream. John Locke's influence can still be seen in several governmental documents and in the practice of democracy and individual freedoms.

            <i>Montesquieu</i>
        </h2>
        <section style="margin-right: 25px; margin-left:25px;">
            Montesquieu was a French philosopher who largely focused on politics and law. Not only was Montesquieu a philosopher, but he was actually a practicing judge. His experience in the courts pushed him to stress the importance of laws and protection of the individual. Born on January 18th, 1689, Montesquieu would go on to impact political theory throughout Europe and the United States. His seminal work, The Spirit of Laws, consists of four volumes discussing the meaning, purpose, and results of law. He is often credited with the ideas of checks and balances, having urged governments to include political limits in order to perserve the nation. Montesquieu was also extremely well read on foreign relations and would often compare French politics to that of other nations. He would lament his own monarchy for overstepping their reach and criticized monarchical rule. Montesquieu's work can most obviously be seen in the separation of powers within government and the role of the judicial system as well as its limitations.

            <i>Thomas Hobbes</i>
        </h2>
        <section style="margin-right: 25px; margin-left:25px;">
            Thomas Hobbes worked on political, social, and mathematical philsophy during his lifetime. Born on April 5th, 1588, Hobbes lived in England and made a name for himself as a scientist and historian along with a philosopher. He also enjoyed studying physics and would go on to defend materialism, the idea that only material things are real. Highly intellectual, Hobbes actually taught himself in the sciences and maths, rather than having a proper education. Having earned himself a reputation for being a hot head, Thomas Hobbes eventually feared for his safety from the English government. His writings would critique the outdated practices of the English monarchy and so, in 1640, Hobbes would flee to Paris where he had gathered a group of philosophical friends. He would go down in history as having influenced the ideals behind democracy, political liberty, and morality.
